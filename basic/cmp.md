## 什么是CMP
CMP全称是cloud management platform, 云管平台，简单来说, CMP是一个统一化管理异构云计算产品（私有云、公有云、虚拟化）的平台。

更加正式一点，参考`Gartner`对于云管理平台的定义：

Cloud management platforms are integrated products that provide for the management of public, private and hybrid cloud environments. The minimum requirements to be included in this category are products that incorporate self-service interfaces, provision system images, enable metering and billing, and provide for some degree of workload optimization through established policies. More-advanced offerings may also integrate with external enterprise management systems, include service catalogs, support the configuration of storage and network resources, allow for enhanced resource management via service governors and provide advanced monitoring for improved "guest" performance and availability.

根据`Gartner`的定义，一个合适的云管平台，至少要包含以下功能：
* 自服务能力
* 异构虚拟化纳管
* 容量和配额管理
* 计费
* 生命周期管理
* 服务目录
* 工作负载调度
